# WhatsApp Send

Don't have time to save the number?
An unknown number called you and you want to know if they have WhatsApp?
You need to send a message to someone but you don't want to save it as a contact?
Or you want to send a message to yourself...
Just open the app and enter the number and your country code. That's all.
